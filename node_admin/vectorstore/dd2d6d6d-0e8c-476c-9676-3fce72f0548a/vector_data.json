物理维度\n哇，星空就像一个超级大的游乐园，亮晶晶的星星到处跳舞！\n\n- **空间结构（地理×社会阶层分布图）**：银河中心是金光闪闪的“贵族糖果星球”，住着胖嘟嘟的王室外星人，他们有大城堡，吃甜甜的星糖；中间环是“冒险者彩虹带”，各种小动物外星人玩捉迷藏，豆豆最爱这里追光球；外缘是“流浪者黑洞边”，穷穷的拾荒者躲在阴影里捡破烂。小米可以钻进彩虹带找伙伴修飞船，但贵族星球的守护泡泡会弹开闯入者，造成空间抖动让飞船碎片乱飞；或者冒险外缘，黑洞会吸走不小心掉队的猫咪，迫使小米决定救豆豆还是直奔回家星轨。\n\n- **时间轴（关键历史事件年表）**：1000年前，“大星星派对”上大家手拉手跳舞，结果黑暗云怪偷走光球，银河变暗；50年前，友好外星人爷爷发明“嬉戏飞船”带小孩玩；现在，“意外损坏夜”，小米和豆豆的飞船啪嚓坏了，正好黑暗势力揉眼睛醒来；未来7天内，若不找齐3颗“回家星星”，星轨会永远关门。小米偷星星时，时间泡泡会加速或倒退，让她看到过去怪物大战，决定是躲还是学招式打黑暗云。\n\n- **法则体系（物理/魔法/社会规则的漏洞点）**：物理规则，重力像蹦床，随小米开心跳高，但黑暗云靠近时变黏黏陷阱；魔法星尘许愿超神奇，说“飞回家”能瞬移，但漏洞是得先喂豆豆一颗不然反噬变迷路鬼；社会规则，不准地球小孩摸“禁飞船核心”，小米偷偷戳会引发连锁爆炸，炸开新捷径但也叫醒附近睡怪物，迫使她选修船还是逃跑结新朋友。\n\n### 2. 社会维度\n星空朋友好多好玩，但有些大坏蛋想抢我们的糖！\n\n- **权力结构断层线（可引发冲突的阶层/种族/组织矛盾）**：贵族外星人高高在上，骑光龙管中间冒险者种族（如毛茸茸的猫人族，豆豆亲戚）；外缘拾荒者恨贵族偷他们的星晶，黑暗势力是古老黑影组织，偷偷拉拢拾荒者反叛。小米若帮冒险者偷贵族糖果，会触发种族大战，让拾荒者当盟友修飞船，但也引黑暗势力追杀，决定是联手打贵族还是独闯黑洞边。\n\n- **文化禁忌（可被打破的禁忌及其后果）**：超级禁忌“不准地球小孩和外星猫玩星尘球”，因为怕唤醒黑暗云；小米打破扔给豆豆，会让所有猫人族欢呼加入冒险队，星轨亮起回家灯，但贵族生气封锁彩虹带，迫使小米绕远路遇新怪物；另一个禁忌“别叫醒睡星星”，小米大喊会让星星喷光弹打黑暗，但也吵醒更多云怪，选喊不喊决定伙伴多还是敌人猛。\n\n- **经济命脉（资源争夺焦点）**：大家抢“闪闪星晶”，贵族囤在城堡做糖，冒险者挖彩虹带矿，拾荒者捡黑洞渣。小米用星晶修飞船，能从冒险者换友情晶（多伙伴），或偷贵族大晶（快回家但被追），黑暗势力想全抢灭光；豆豆爪子挠晶会裂开隐藏地图，决定卖晶买路还是留着冒险，影响银河灯亮不亮。\n\n### 3. 隐喻维度\n星空像我的大玩具箱，亮的地方暖暖的，黑的地方有点怕怕！\n\n- **贯穿全书的视觉符号系统（如反复出现的意象）**：闪烁小星星是“希望灯泡”，小米每次迷路它眨眼指路，豆豆扑它玩；旋转彩虹环是“友情圈圈”，结识伙伴时变大包围大家；黑吞云是“孤独怪”，靠近时星星灭，角色若分享秘密它缩小。小米决定追星星灯泡，会亮起新伙伴营地；忽略彩虹环，飞船卡住；戳黑云，冒险变恐怖追逐。\n\n- **气候/环境变化映射的心理状态**：晴朗星雨时，小米超级开心，像在家吃糖，飞船动力满满修好快；风暴云卷来，内心慌慌想妈妈，空间扭曲让星轨藏猫猫，豆豆躲小米怀里；温暖光雾飘，勇敢心爆棚，黑暗势力现形好打。小米选冲风暴（冒险找伙伴，心理成长）或等晴（安全但时间溜走永陷孤寂）。\n\n- **建筑风格暗示的文明困境**：贵族城堡是亮晶晶糖塔，高高在上但易塌（贪婪孤独）；冒险者窝是彩虹帐篷，晃晃悠悠但弹性强（友情救命）；拾荒者洞是黑洞窝，挤挤但藏宝（绝望中希望）。小米钻糖塔偷晶，塔塌砸黑暗云但贵族恨她；搭帐篷过夜，伙伴教魔法修船；进黑洞窝，找隐藏星轨但陷心理迷宫，决定风格影响回家快慢与银河和平。\n\n#=== 4) 三幕式情节架构 ===\n### 第一幕（触发）\n\n哇，星空好大好亮，像超级游乐园里到处跳舞的糖果星星，我是小米，13岁，和我的猫咪豆豆最爱晚上趴窗台看它们眨眼睛，幻想飞上去玩捉迷藏！\n\n**日常状态中的异常征兆（3处铺垫）**：  \n1. 星星们平时开心转圈圈，今晚却一个劲儿眨快眼，像在偷偷哭泣，预示飞船坏掉的星尘漏气。  \n2. 豆豆平时追尾巴玩，今晚毛炸开，冲黑云方向呜呜叫，暗示黑暗势力揉眼醒来。  \n3.
